## Notes for later

### General
* First and foremost, I should update README as I go.

### HTML
#### Page reload on submit
When I was making my settings form I, I encountered a problem where hitting Enter would refresh the whole page without saving the settings. At first I just changed the type of the button to `type="button"` thinking about coming back to it later after I finish implementing general features of the form and then this [comprehensive README](https://github.com/Saranoya/odin/blob/master/javascript/library/public/README.md) provided the solution to this very problem.
```javascript
<form id="add-new-book", onsubmit="return false">
...
</form>
```
